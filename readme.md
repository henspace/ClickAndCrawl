# ClickAndCrawl

A simple dungeon crawler designed for casual dungeon crawling. If you'd like to 
play it, you can find the end result at https://henspace.itch.io/click-and-crawl

First a heads-up. The dungeon crawler took a massive detour from the direction it was
originally expected to take. It was originally expected to be a very rapid hacky piece
of code.

Originally, the code was structured to avoid the use of classes and private members, 
but then part way through I flipped the approach on its head. The result, a monster
mishmash of ideas and approaches. 

I truly have created a level 1 Spaghetti Monster.

## Spaghetti Monster

- Armour class: 999: impossible to break this monster now
- Hit points: 100D20 + 100
- Speed: 0 ft. Painfully slow to move through the code now

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 20  | 1   | 1   | 1   |  1  |  1  |

### Actions

The Spaghetti Monster is resistant to change and if it detects anyone trying to
tamper with its inner workings, it will release a horde of fire bugs to inflict
1D20 damage on any programmer within its range.
